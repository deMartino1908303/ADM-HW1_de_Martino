# ADM-HW1_de_Martino
in this repo i am turning in my homework for the ADM course 


**IMPORTANT**
The code is not commented as I do not have much time left to turn in the order of the exercise is in the order of the submission page of hackerank.
There are some exercise that i did that are not from the homework i hope that it may count as bonus effort in programing rather than out of the commision.
I hate regex, silicon does not need the ability to read
